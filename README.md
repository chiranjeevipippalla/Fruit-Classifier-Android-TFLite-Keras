# Fruit-Classifier-Android-TFLite-Keras

Classification of fruits (Apples and Bananas) with Android, TFLite and Keras.

Download the app from the following link <a href="https://github.com/chiranjeevipippalla/Fruit-Classifier-Android-TFLite-Keras/blob/master/app-debug.apk">Fruit Classifier App</a> and share your results @ pippalla.chiranjeevi@gmail.com

Take a picture of a fruit and the app will predict the name of the fruit. Here the number of categories are restricted to two. But, you can extend the classification of categories to any extent you want by increasing the output nodes in the model and also by training those images.
